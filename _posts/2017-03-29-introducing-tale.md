Git isn't hard. Git isn't complicated. It's probably the amount of jargon thrown at your face that makes it look complicated.

### Before you start

We will use of lot of editing in this bootcamp. A nice light-weight IDE will be your best buddy. We recommend VS Code.

Visit https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac to install VSCode on your Mac. Make sure you also install the terminal command:

- Open the Command Palette (⇧⌘P) and type 'shell command' to find the Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH command. - Restart the terminal for the new $PATH value to take effect. You'll be able to type 'code .' in any folder to start editing files in that folder.

### Lets get started

- Open your Mac Terminal and type the following commands:

```bash
    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/wbootcamp/wbootcamp.github.io.git
    ls -larthS | grep wbootcamp
```


What do you see ? Note down your comments. What do you think the above set of commands did?

Now, type the following command:

```bash
    cd wbootcamp.github.io
    
```
