This is a very exciting course but also has a learning curve. Lets start with getting our tools. Make sure to install the following on your Mac. (Get ready with your command line):

#### VITAL
1. Open your terminal and type:
```bash
    python --version
    python3 --version
```

If you have both Python2 and Python3, you're good to go. Otherwise, install Python 2 and 3 using brew. Note that doing `brew install python` will install Python 3.

2. If you do not have Homebrew, [Install Homebrew](http://brew.sh/#install)
3. [Install Anaconda 3 for Mac](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos)

#### What is `pip`?

- PIP is a package manager for Python packages, or modules if you like. It allows you to download and install Python libraries.


#### What is `Anaconda`?

- Python, by itself comes with a limited set of libraries, and we often require many libraries than that. So, a company called Continuum decided to package Python with a bunch of commonly used libraries and call it "Anaconda". Anaconda can now manage and install libraries and doesn't require `pip`, which is Python's own package manager.

4. Install Jupyter

```bash
    pip install jupyter
```

Or, if using conda,

```bash
    conda install jupyter
```

5. Install Visual Studio Code and PyCharm


#### DESIRED / ADVANCED

1. [Install TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/)
2. [Install Keras](https://keras.io/#installation)
3. [Install OpenCV - this one is quite messy and hard](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/12/19/install-opencv-3-on-macos-with-homebrew-the-easy-way/ )
