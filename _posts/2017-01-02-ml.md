This is a very exciting course but also has a learning curve. Lets start with getting our tools. Make sure to install the following on your Mac. (Get ready with your command line):


1. Open your terminal and type:
```bash
    python --version
    python3 --version
```

If you have both Python2 and Python3, you're good to go. Otherwise, install Python 2 and 3 using brew. Note that doing `brew install python` will install Python 3.

2. If you do not have Homebrew, [Install Homebrew](http://brew.sh/#install)
